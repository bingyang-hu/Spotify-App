+ an dependency needs to be installed under right directory. For instance, at first I installed nodemon inside client rather than under root then error pops up when I try to 'npm start' under root directory.

+ why we can use 'npm start' to start index.js?

+ 'Expressapp listenning at' .... vs. new web browser showing 'log into Spofity'.

+ gitignore file
